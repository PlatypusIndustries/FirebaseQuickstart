To get started:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Add your app's credentials to the ./firebaseConfig.js file (All of the information you need is at https://console.firebase.google.com > Your-App > Add firebase to your web app.
3. Add "import firebaseApp from './firebaseRef.js';" to the import list of any file you want to access Firebase from.
4. Invoke Firebase methods by using the firebaseApp namespace like so: firebaseApp.auth(), firebaseApp.database(), etc...

Enjoy!
